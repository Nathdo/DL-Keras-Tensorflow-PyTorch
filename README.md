# Deep Learning Projects – Keras, TensorFlow & PyTorch

Welcome to my Deep Learning repository!

This space contains a collection of practical and educational projects built with **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch** — three of the most widely used frameworks in the world of machine learning.

## What You’ll Find Here
Each project is implemented in a clean and well-documented Jupyter notebook, focusing on the following themes:

* Classification – Image and numerical data

* Regression – Simple examples with custom metrics

* Custom Loss Functions – Tailored objectives for specific tasks

* Callbacks – Early stopping, model checkpoints, learning rate schedulers

* Experiments – Comparing optimizers, architectures, and techniques

* Evaluation – Use of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC
